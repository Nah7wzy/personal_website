                <p>I am a student at Addis Ababa institute of Technology with the dream of becoming <br>
                a very skilled programmer. I have a lot to my story but i like to share a very <br>
                 portion of it since i believe I am a very closed person or as people refer to me <br>
                as. <br><br> I really find the joy in watching movies and better yet, criticing and recommending <br>
                them. I spend my time on looking for the right movie as much as I do on wathing them <br>
                and through time I have developed a good sixth sense about movies. I give movie reviews<br>
                from time to time and I do recommend movies i have found as a masterpiece to many of <br>
                my peers and on the platforms I get as I did on this website. <br><br>
                My current life at AAiT institute has been well so far. I have been able to take <br>
                good knowledge and been part of several essential projects. I have developed as an <br>
                aspiring programmer and a good person with a better social life that has been essential <br>
                in my growth as a person.
