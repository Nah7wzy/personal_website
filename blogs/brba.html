               <h1>Breaking Bad <br></h1>
               <p>Even though this is a series, I couldn't resist to put it in my list. <br>
                This is without a doubt the best series to ever air. Unmatchable acting <br>
                performances from Bryan cranston and Aaron paul puts this show up the list. <br>
                It shows one of the most entertaining plots that is very much realistic <br>
                which allows the user to feel every moment. This series has a 0 predictability <br>
                as it is very much different from the shows you see and it is, to say in short, <br>
                amazingly made to the point of perfection. With a big replay value, This is an <br>
                unmissable show you must atleast watch once in your life! </p>
